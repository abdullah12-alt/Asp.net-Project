#### **What are DTOs?**  
- DTOs are objects used to transfer data between layers of an application.  
- They are simplified versions of domain models containing only necessary properties.  
- Commonly used for transferring data over networks or between application layers.  

#### **Why use DTOs?**  
1. **Separation of Concerns**  
   - Domain objects are tightly coupled with the database schema.  
   - DTOs provide an abstraction, matching business requirements rather than internal data models.  

2. **Performance**  
   - Send only the required data to improve application efficiency.  
   - Example: Instead of sending all region data, only send the region name if needed.  

3. **Security**  
   - Reduces the risk of exposing sensitive data by limiting client-facing information.  

4. **Versioning**  
   - Enables independent versioning of the API and the domain model.  
   - Prevents breaking changes for existing clients when domain models evolve.  

#### **How are DTOs used in applications?**  
- Domain models are fetched using tools like **Entity Framework Core**, which maps database tables to domain objects.  
- These domain models are then **mapped** to DTOs to expose only the required information to clients.  
- When receiving data from the client, DTOs are mapped back into domain models for database operations.  

#### **Benefits Recap**  
- Promotes **separation of concerns** between layers.  
- Enhances **performance** by minimizing unnecessary data transfer.  
- Improves **security** by reducing exposed sensitive data.  
- Facilitates **API versioning** without breaking client integrations.
