1. **Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Programming**:
   - **Synchronous programming** blocks the program while waiting for operations (like database queries) to complete, which can degrade performance and cause UI unresponsiveness.
   - **Asynchronous programming** allows the program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for long-running operations to finish. This improves performance and responsiveness, 
	making it suitable for handling multiple requests at once.

2. **Using Async and Await**:
   - The **`async`** keyword is used in method definitions to mark the method as asynchronous. The return type of these methods is usually **`Task`**, which represents a process that may be running in the background.
   - The **`await`** keyword is used before an operation to ensure the program doesn't block the thread while waiting for that operation (like a database call) to finish. This helps to avoid delays and keep the application responsive.

3. **Implementing Asynchronous Programming in Controller Methods**:
   - In the `GetAll` method, the database query is wrapped with the `await` keyword, and the `ToListAsync` method is used to make the database query asynchronous.
   - The `Post` method also uses `await` with asynchronous methods like `AddAsync` and `SaveChangesAsync`, making the process of adding data to the database non-blocking.
   - The update and get methods are similarly converted to asynchronous methods using `FirstOrDefaultAsync`, `AddAsync`, and `SaveChangesAsync`.

By converting synchronous database calls to asynchronous ones, the application can handle more requests simultaneously, improve scalability, and ensure a better user experience.
